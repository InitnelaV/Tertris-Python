Finally!
After several months working on it, where I had to stop, resume, and revisit the script’s logic, my Python Tetris version is now complete, largely following Nick KOUMARIS’s method from "Programming with Nick" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ivOTE5EgpmF2DHLBmWIWg). These tutorials are exceptional! His teaching approach is unmatched—huge thanks to Nick.

The script includes a few minor modifications to its structure, but Nick’s pedagogy is by far the most suitable for my level, as I’m still a novice on the subject.

Here’s the tutorial I followed for the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF_crEtmpBo

Have fun, and feel free to share, reuse, or modify it! ;)
